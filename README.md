# GARDEN_PARADISE
One of my projects from my second year at university

## A note from me (the developer)
This project is an archived copy of the majority of my commits in December of 2022\
It was my first major project written in C\
It features a linked list implementation, a triple pointer (yes, I do mean `***`)
and best of all, some bit operations.

Any lucky viewers of this project can enjoy the functionally objected-oriented code I have written


## A note to potential employers
Please hire me.\
